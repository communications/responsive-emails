#ulster.ac.uk responsive email templates

##Synopsis

Foundation for Emails takes the pain out of developing HTML emails by giving you a set of powerful, tested components out of the box. This includes a fully-responsive grid, buttons, callouts, menus, and more.

##Usage

Daro - /ulster-responsive-emails/src/pages/daro.html

##Installation

Get started with the Sass-powered ZURB Stack for writing HTML emails.

http://foundation.zurb.com/emails/docs/sass-guide.html

###The Settings File
All Foundation projects include a settings file, named _settings.scss. If you're using the ZURB Stack, you can find the settings file under src/assets/scss/.

###Running the Server
After your project has been installed, run cd project, where project is the name of the project just created. Then run:

npm start

This will kick off the build process, which includes HTML parsing, Sass, image compression, and a server. When the initial build finishes, your browser will pop open a new tab pointing to your project. You'll be seeing a blank index.html file.

##Testing

If the foundation for emails frontend is strictly adhered to, then testing should be minimal as these components and temaplates have already been rigoursy tested with Litmus.
